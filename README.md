## Database Design

The database schema will consist of the following key entities and their relationships:

| Entity       | Key Fields                                                                | Relationships                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**     | `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `full_name`, `role`                       | A user can own multiple properties and create multiple bookings and reviews. |
| **Property** | `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`               | A property is owned by a user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.    |
| **Booking**  | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`        | A booking belongs to a user and is linked to a specific property.            |
| **Review**   | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`         | A review is written by a user for a specific property.                       |
| **Payment**  | `id`, `user_id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_status`, `payment_date` | A payment is associated with a user and a booking.                           |

### Key Relationships

* A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
* A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
* A **Booking** belongs to one **Property** and one **User**.
* A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**.
* A **Payment** is linked to a **Booking** and a **User**.

## Feature Breakdown

| Feature                 | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Management**     | Handles user registration, login, profile management, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the platform. |
| **Property Management** | Allows users (hosts) to list properties, update property details, and manage availability and pricing of their listings.    |
| **Booking System**      | Enables users (guests) to search for available properties, make bookings, manage reservations, and view booking history.    |
| **Review System**       | Facilitates user-generated reviews and ratings for properties, enhancing trust and transparency on the platform.            |
| **Payment Processing**  | Handles secure payment transactions related to bookings, including tracking payment status and generating receipts.         |

## API Security

Key security measures implemented in this project include:

| Security Measure                   | Importance                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**                 | Ensures that only registered users can access protected resources by verifying user identity (e.g., using JWT or session tokens).     |
| **Authorization**                  | Restricts access based on user roles (e.g., host vs guest) to ensure users can only perform permitted actions.                        |
| **Rate Limiting**                  | Protects the API from abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given time. |
| **Data Validation & Sanitization** | Prevents injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) by validating and cleaning user inputs before processing.                       |
| **Secure Payments**                | Safeguards financial transactions and sensitive user data using secure payment gateways and encrypted communications.                 |

CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate building, testing, and deploying the application, ensuring faster, safer, and more reliable releases.

Why CI/CD is important

* Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment, reducing human errors.
* Ensures immediate feedback on code changes through automated tests.
* Enables seamless and consistent deployments to development, staging, and production environments.

Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates workflows such as testing, building Docker images, and deploying applications.
Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development and production by containerizing the application.
